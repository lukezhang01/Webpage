	<h3>Strong AI</h3>
	<p class="para">Strong AI, also known as True Intelligence or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), is a theoretical form of machine intelligence that is equal to human intelligence. 
	This form of artificial intelligence is what is sometimes portrayed in sci-fi movies like the robots from iRobot or Star Trek. Strong AI consists of equivalent human consciousness, objective thoughts, self-awareness, sentience, and sapience.

    <p class="para">Strong AI does not currently exist. Strong AI has been pursed for a long time by theorists and experts however time hasn't eased the difficulty of essentially creating a machine with a full set of cognitive abilities. 
    Some say it will be a possibility in the next 25 years, while others say itâ€™ll take at least a century or the idea of creating intelligence is not possible to begin with.
    <br><br>
    If Strong AI does exist however, there will be both benefits and concerns regarding such drastic changes towards society as we know it. As shown already with applications of AI, the development of technology has replaced many low level labour. 
    With the implementation of Stong AI, even highly skilled workers performing complicated tasks will be replaced by AI. Such high rates of unemployment may lead to unimaginable futures, leaving it uncertain whether Strong AI will truly benefit society.
