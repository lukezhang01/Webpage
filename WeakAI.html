	<h3>Weak AI</h3>
	<p class="para">Weak AI, often also referred to as ‘Narrow AI’ is the most appropriate recognition of AI seen today. To compare it to Strong AI, Weak AI is not to mimic or replicate human intelligence, 
	instead, Weak AI is a system designed to carry out only one particular job or task, hence the word ‘weak’ and ‘narrow’. By automating time-consuming processes and analyzing data much faster 
	than the ability of a human, it has provided significant benefit to society. In the past few years, Weak AI has made many outstanding breakthroughs, all while staying focused on performing just one task. </p>

	<p>Some applicants of Weak AI may include:</p>
	    <ul>
	        <li>Google search </li>
	        <li>Image recognition software</li>
	        <li>Siri, Alexa and other personal assistants</li>
	        <li>Bot chess player</li>

    <p class="para">The basis of Weak AI is to simulate human intelligence by performing one task extremely well. This can be visualized through John Searle’s Chinese room thought experiment. The idea is a native Chinese speaker is able to have a conversation with a person who does not know anything about Chinese, but is given instructions on how to respond. While they appear to be speaking Chinese, all they are doing is following the set of instructions very fluently.
