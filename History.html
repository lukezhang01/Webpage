	<h3>The History of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
	<p class="para">In the year 1950, Alan Turing introduces  "Computing Machines and Intelligence," also known as the Turing Test, evaluating whether 
	or not a computer is intelligent based on a computer's ability to trick interrogators into thinking the answers to their questions were written by a person.
    <br><br>
    In the year 1956, the word "artificial intelligence" was first used at a conference. The meeting, which described the scope and objectives of AI and was led by John McCarthy, 
    and is generally recognized as the birth of artificial intelligence as we know it today.

    <p class="para">The development of artificial general intelligence slowed drastically due to limitations in computer processing and memory and by the complexity of the 
    problem faced. The government and industries no longer provided funding for AI science, resulting in the first "AI Winter," which lasted from 1974 to 1980.
    <br><br>
    In the 1980s, research on deep learning techniques sparked a new wave of AI enthusiasm, only only to lead to another AI Winter, which until the mid-1990s.
    <br><br>
    In the late 1990s, AI development began to gain momentum again as the computational power and computer capabilities improved.
    <br><br>
    In the recent years, AI has made many breakthroughs in natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, machine learning, deep learning and more.
