	<h3>Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h3>
	<p class="para">Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn and develop on their own without needing to 
	be directly programmed. Machine learning is the focus where computer programs that can access data and learn on their own with no need for human intervention 
	or assistance and adjust actions accordingly. 
    <br><br>
    Deep learning is the set of algorthims developed to carry out the idea of machine learning. It is the neural networks where the data is processed, allowing the machine 
    to go "deep" in its learning, making connections and weighting input for the best results.

    <p>Machine learning feeds data to a computer and uses mathematical methods to learn how get better at a job without being hard coded for the specific task.
    Machine learning consists of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unsupervised learning:</strong> Data sets are labeled so that patterns can be detected and used to label new data sets.</li>
        <li><strong>Supervised learning:</strong> Data sets aren't labeled and are sorted according to similarities or differences.</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement learning:</strong> Data sets aren't labeled but, after performing an action or several actions, the AI system is given feedback.</li>
    </ul>
