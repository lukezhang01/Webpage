	<h3>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
	<img class="Image" src="https://technology-signals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/images.martechadvisor.comai_and_human_intelligence-01b035e328ac4019c47acb6442af0c5b8b4c5fcb.jpg" alt="aiimage">
	<p class="para"> Artificial intelligence (AI) is the replication of human intelligence with the use of machines programmed to think and imitate human behavior. The word can also be extended to any system that shows features linked to a human mind, such as understanding and problem-solving.<br>
	<br> As technology continues to advance, what was thought to be the limits of artificial intelligence has become fully possible, if not already incorporated into everyday electronics. Machines that calculate basic functions or recognize text through optical character recognition mightâ€™ve once been considered revolutionary are now the most basic of technological functions.
